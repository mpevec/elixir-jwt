# JwtExample

A small Elixir application showing how to create and verify JWT using Plugs and JOSE library. More information on my two blog articles:
* [Elixir Plug and JWT](https://dev.to/mpevec9/elixir-plug-and-jwt-4ijm)
* [Elixir, Releases, and Docker](https://dev.to/mpevec9/elixir-releases-and-docker-2o47)

## Installation

Checkout the code, pull the deps and run the application.
Within sources there are two http files which can be used for testing - using Code and its REST client plugin. Enjoy!
