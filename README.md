# JwtExample

A small Elixir application showing how to create and verify JWT using Plugs and JOSE library. More information on my [blog] (https://dev.to/mpevec9/elixir-plug-and-jwt-4ijm)

## Installation

Checkout the code, pull the deps and run the application.
Within sources there are two http files which can be used for testing - using Code and its REST client plugin. Enjoy!
